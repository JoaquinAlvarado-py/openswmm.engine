# load_parity.sh — the parity gate for the model-load optimization program
# (plan Phase 0.4).
#
# Several of the planned optimizations change lookup or iteration order (hash
# instead of linear scan, memoized transect tables, bulk SoA growth). None of
# them may change results. For each model this gate compares three artifacts:
#
#   (a) the .rpt with wall-clock/version lines masked out
#   (b) the .out binary, byte for byte
#   (c) the written-back .inp (the parsed+resolved model)
#
# Usage:
#   load_parity.sh record <probe> <ref-dir> [model ...]
#   load_parity.sh check  <probe> <ref-dir> [model ...]
#   load_parity.sh selfcheck <probe> [model ...]
#
#   record     capture reference artifacts with the CURRENT build
#   check      re-run and diff against a previously recorded reference
#   selfcheck  record then check with the same binary — proves the engine's
#              own output is deterministic, so a later `check` failure means a
#              real behavioral change rather than run-to-run noise
#
# <probe> is the parity_probe executable (tests/benchmarks/parity_probe.cpp).
# With no explicit models, the default set below is used.

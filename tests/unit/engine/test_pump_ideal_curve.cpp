 * @file test_pump_ideal_curve.cpp
 * @brief `[PUMPS]` curve column "*" — the ideal-pump placeholder.
 *
 * @details Legacy `pump_readParams` (link.c:1437) accepts "*" in place of a
 *          pump curve name and leaves `pumpCurve = -1`, which `pump_validate`
 *          then types as IDEAL_PUMP (flow = inlet node inflow). The refactored
 *          parser looked "*" up in the curve table and the post-parse resolver
 *          raised a fatal `ERROR 209: undefined object *.`, so any model with
 *          an ideal pump failed to open.
 *
 *          That path is reachable from the GUI without the user ever typing an
 *          asterisk: `InpWriter` emits "*" for an unset curve index, so saving
 *          a model that contains an ideal pump produced an `.inp` the engine
 *          then refused to re-open.
 *
 *          The working directory is tests/unit/engine/data/ (see CMakeLists),
 *          so the fixture is referenced as pumps/ideal_pump.inp and every
 *          artifact is written under pumps/ where it can be reviewed.

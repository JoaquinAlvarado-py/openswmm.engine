 * @file test_ard_node_store.cpp
 * @brief The ARD node store mixes before it discharges, at any ROUTING_STEP.
 *
 * @details The store used to apply the external load and the face inflows
 *          AFTER reading the donor concentration the outflow faces carry.
 *          That is a forward-Euler CSTR, and a junction's own volume is far
 *          smaller than what passes through it in a routing step, so it ran
 *          well past its stability bound and failed in both directions:
 *
 *          - The face debit could exceed the store, and `max(0.0, ...)` on
 *            volume swallowed the excess while the matching mass debit
 *            stood. A steady 5 cfs / 100 mg/L inflow published 70.6 mg/L at
 *            ROUTING_STEP 5, and 53.9 at 20.
 *          - Above ROUTING_STEP ~10 the oscillation diverged and the floor
 *            at zero clipped its negative half, MANUFACTURING mass: 7730
 *            mg/L out of a 100 mg/L inflow, compounding link by link.
 *
 *          Observation paths, each chosen so it cannot pass for the wrong
 *          reason:
 *          - SteadyInflowIsTransportedExactlyAtEveryRoutingStep: the deck
 *            has ONE steady source and NO decay, so the analytic answer is
 *            "every element equals the inflow concentration" independent of
 *            step size, mesh, and hydraulics. It is also checked against
 *            LEGACY on the same deck, so a shared misreading of the deck
 *            cannot hide behind it (the ARD-vs-LEGACY split is what
 *            identified the defect in the first place).
 *          - NoElementEverExceedsTheInflowConcentration: the maximum
 *            principle, sampled at EVERY step rather than at the end. Mass
 *            manufacture shows up here even when the final state has
 *            relaxed back, and a single element over the bound fails it.
 *          - StoreStaysBoundedWhenThroughputDwarfsStoreVolume: drives
 *            dt*q/V to ~40 deliberately. This is the regime the old code
 *            diverged in; the mixed donor is a weighted average, so it
 *            cannot.

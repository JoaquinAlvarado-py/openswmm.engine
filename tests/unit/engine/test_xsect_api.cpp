 * \brief  Standalone cross-section geometry C API (openswmm_xsect.h).
 *
 * Covers:
 *   1. ShapeEnumParity  — SWMM_XSectShape codes select the shape they name.
 *   2. Analytic         — closed-form shapes match textbook formulas exactly.
 *   3. Tabulated        — handle results == direct xsect:: calls (guards the
 *                         ABI→batch enum translation for every shape).
 *   4. Inverse          — depth_of_area / area_of_sectfactor round-trip.
 *   5. Units            — US vs SI agree after conversion.
 *   6. Irregular/Custom/Street — tabulated constructors.
 *   7. LinkBound        — swmm_link_create_xsect matches standalone, and the
 *                         handle survives the engine that produced it.
 *   8. Errors           — bad shape / negative / NULL / NaN rejected.
 *   9. Arrays           — array forms == scalar loop.

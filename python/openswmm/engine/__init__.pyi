Type stubs for the L{openswmm.engine} package.

Cython bindings for the OpenSWMM Engine 6.0 C API, providing classes for
engine lifecycle management, programmatic model building, domain object
access, hot start file management, mass balance queries, runtime forcing,
water quality, spatial data, and GeoPackage I/O.

 * @file openswmm_edit.h
 * @brief OpenSWMM Engine — Model editing C API (deletion and type conversion).
 *
 * @details Provides two capabilities for interactive model editing:
 *
 *   **1. Object deletion** — remove any node, link, subcatchment, rain gage,
 *   table/curve, or transect from the model while the engine is in BUILDING
 *   or OPENED state.  A pre-deletion impact-analysis function is provided so
 *   callers can inspect what would be affected before committing.
 *
 *   **2. Type conversion** — convert a node between JUNCTION/OUTFALL/STORAGE/
 *   DIVIDER, or a link between CONDUIT/PUMP/ORIFICE/WEIR/OUTLET, in-place.
 *   Common properties are preserved; type-specific properties are cleared and
 *   sensible defaults are applied.
 *
 * @section edit_safety Safety guards
 *
 *   All mutating operations (delete, convert) require the engine to be in
 *   SWMM_STATE_BUILDING or SWMM_STATE_OPENED.  The impact-analysis functions
 *   are read-only and work in any state where data is present (not CREATED,
 *   CLOSED, or ERROR).

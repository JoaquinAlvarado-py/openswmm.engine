/**
 * @file PluginDiscovery.hpp
 * @brief Public, framework-free facade for enumerating plugin file filters.
 *
 * @details Hosts (Qt GUIs, CLI tools, Python bindings) typically only need to
 *          know what file formats the engine and its plugins handle, not the
 *          full lifecycle. This header exposes a one-shot discovery facade
 *          that walks every built-in default plugin plus every on-disk
 *          plugin shared library, and returns the flat list of FileFilter
 *          entries each plugin advertises.
 *
 *          Internally this constructs a transient `PluginFactory`, so calling
 *          `discover_all_filters()` triggers a directory scan. Callers should
 *          cache the result.

/* =========================================================================
 * Export macro
 *
 * The engine target sets WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS OFF and relies on explicit
 * export macros (see src/engine/CMakeLists.txt). On ELF/Mach-O the target's
 * CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET is `default`, so omitting the macro still exports the
 * symbol — which is why the unannotated declarations below linked fine on
 * Linux/macOS while failing on Windows with:
 *     error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol openswmm::discover_all_filters
 * Block is byte-identical to the one in openswmm_engine.h / openswmm_2d.h;
 * identical macro redefinition is well-defined, so including those alongside
 * this header is safe.

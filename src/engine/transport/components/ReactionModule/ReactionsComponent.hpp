 * @file ReactionsComponent.hpp
 * @brief The `org.hydrocouple.openswmm.reactions` process component —
 *        phase R1: parse `model.rxn` [REACTION_*] sections into
 *        ReactionData + the species registry.
 *
 * @details R1 scope: structure and references are fully validated (species
 *          declared before use, unique names, no collision with pollutant
 *          names, valid forms/kinds/options); expression BODIES are stored
 *          as source and compiled by phase R2's Tier-1 VM. Sections whose
 *          semantics land in later phases ([REACTION_SOURCES],
 *          [REACTION_PARAMETERS], [REACTION_PATTERNS], [REACTION_REPORT],
 *          [REACTION_SUBCATCHMENTS]) produce a precise
 *          "arrives with plan phase …" error rather than being silently
 *          accepted. Embedded [REACTION_*] sections in the legacy .inp are
 *          honored with a style warning when no external component is
 *          registered; the external file wins wholesale on conflict
 *          (TRANSPORT_IO_PLUGIN_CONFIG_PLAN §3.2).

 * @file ReactionLegacyBinding.hpp
 * @brief Phase R4 — reaction binding for the LEGACY (CSTR) quality engine.
 *
 * @details When a reactions component is configured:
 *          - Pollutant kdecay upgrades from the legacy linearized factor
 *            `(1 − k·dt)` to the EXACT exponential `exp(−k·dt)` at nodes
 *            and links (the "kdecay-as-RATE" semantics realized in closed
 *            form — pollutant decay is exactly first-order, so the
 *            integrator would only approximate what the exponential IS).
 *            Bit-parity holds when NO reactions component is present: the
 *            legacy applyDecay / in-mix decay paths are untouched then.
 *          - MSX species evolve per element (nodes: tank scope; links:
 *            pipe scope) via ReactionIntegrator, with the element's
 *            pollutant concentrations exposed READ-ONLY to their
 *            expressions (PUSH_POLLUT). MSX species are NOT yet transported
 *            between elements under LEGACY (R4b) — a RATE MSX species
 *            triggers a once-per-run warning. EQUIL/FORMULA MSX species
 *            are fully meaningful (element-local algebra over pollutants).
 *          - Integration failures are LOUD but not fatal: the element's
 *            block is left unchanged and a once-per-run warning carries
 *            the element id and the integrator's remedy text.

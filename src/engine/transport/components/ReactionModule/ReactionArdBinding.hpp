 * @file ReactionArdBinding.hpp
 * @brief Phase E4/R6 — reaction binding for the Eulerian ARD engine.
 *
 * @details One reaction stage per ROUTING step on the ARD mesh state,
 *          Lie-split after the advection–dispersion subcycle (first-order
 *          splitting, the documented decision of roadmap lesson 13: the
 *          integrator substeps adaptively inside the stage, routing steps
 *          are short relative to typical kinetics, and the projection error
 *          dominates — revisit if the LEGACY-vs-ARD convergence gate says
 *          otherwise):
 *
 *          1. **Pollutant kdecay as the exact exponential** on every cell
 *             (concentration) and node store (mass) — the closed form of
 *             the implicit first-order RATE the plan's E4 row names. This
 *             runs whether or not a reactions component is configured,
 *             retiring the E1 "kdecay not yet applied" warning.
 *          2. **MSX species integrate per cell** (pipe scope) and **per
 *             node store** (tank scope, HRT populated) via
 *             ReactionIntegrator, with the element's pollutant
 *             concentrations readable (PUSH_POLLUT). FORMULA sees
 *             post-decay pollutants — the R4 ordering, kept identical so
 *             the two bindings agree at the CSTR limit.
 *
 *          MSX species are TRANSPORTED on the mesh under this engine (R6):
 *          the ARD state carries n_pollutants + n_msx species rows, so the
 *          R4b element-local limitation does not apply here. WALL species
 *          have no transport semantics yet — a model with WALL species
 *          under EULERIAN_ARD falls back to LEGACY with a warning.
 *
 *          Failure containment matches R4: a failed integration leaves the
 *          element's block unchanged and warns once per run with the
 *          element kind/index and the integrator's remedy text.

 *                  MSX species in ReactionData order.
 * @param cell_a    Cell areas (read-only; dry cells still react — their
 *                  carried concentration evolves like LEGACY's, and holds
 *                  negligible mass).
 * @param cell_dx   Cell lengths (read-only; E5b — with cell_a they give the
 *                  water volume each kdecay concentration change acts on,
 *                  so the removed pollutant mass books into the
 *                  qual_routing_reacted ledger row).
 * @param node_mass Node-store species MASS [nd * ns_total + s].
 * @param node_vol  Node-store water volume [nd].
 * @param n_pollut  Pollutant row count (may be 0 — MSX-only model).
 * @param ns_total  Total species rows (n_pollut + rx.n_species() when the
 *                  component is active, else n_pollut).
 * @param min_store_vol Below this volume a store has no meaningful
 *                  concentration: MSX tank integration is skipped there
 *                  (mass-form kdecay still applies).

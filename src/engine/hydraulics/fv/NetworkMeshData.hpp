 * @file NetworkMeshData.hpp
 * @brief SoA storage for the 1D finite-volume network mesh and its state.
 *
 * @details The FV counterpart of 2d/data/MeshData.hpp. Three index spaces:
 *
 *            cells  [0, n_cells)  — one control volume, U = [A, Q]
 *            faces  [0, n_faces)  — one interface, flux positive LEFT → RIGHT
 *            nodes  [0, n_nodes)  — the model's SWMM nodes, zero-D volumes
 *
 *          The mesh is INTERNAL numerical discretization and carries no named
 *          objects: conduits are cut into cell chains, virtual junctions become
 *          plain interior faces splicing two chains, and regular nodes become
 *          coupled zero-D volumes reached through boundary faces (plan §3.4).
 *
 *          Static after init — deliberately: fixed-size arrays and a fixed face
 *          graph are what keep the device-resident Kokkos design free of view
 *          rebuilds mid-run. Adaptivity is in time (LTS), not space (plan §3.2).

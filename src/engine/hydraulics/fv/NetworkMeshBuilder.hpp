/**
 * @file NetworkMeshBuilder.hpp
 * @brief Build the FV cell/face mesh from a SimulationContext.
 *
 * @details Runs once at Router::init. The mesh is INTERNAL numerical
 *          discretization — it creates no named objects and is invisible to
 *          topology (plan §3.2). Virtual junctions are consumed here: their two
 *          conduit chains are concatenated into one continuous face graph, so
 *          mass and momentum flux continuity across them become properties of
 *          the scheme rather than a special treatment.
 *

 * @file FvOptions.hpp
 * @brief Option struct for the explicit finite-volume 1D network solver.
 *
 * @details Mirrors the role SolverOptions2D plays for the 2D marcher: a plain
 *          value type carrying every knob the solver reads, populated from the
 *          `FV_*` keys in `[OPTIONS]` (OptionsHandler.cpp) and stored as an
 *          embedded member of SimulationOptions.
 *
 *          Dependency-free by design (no SimulationContext, no Kokkos) so the
 *          GPU plugin can include it across the plain-C ABI boundary.

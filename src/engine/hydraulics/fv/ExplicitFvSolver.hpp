 * @file ExplicitFvSolver.hpp
 * @brief Serial/OpenMP CPU reference implementation of the explicit FV 1D solver.
 *
 * @details Godunov-type explicit finite volume on the conduit cell mesh:
 *          hydrostatic (Audusse) reconstruction → HLLC face flux → positivity
 *          limiting → flux divergence with the bed-slope correction →
 *          semi-implicit friction → explicit zero-D node continuity. Substeps
 *          at the CFL limit to fill each routing step.
 *
 *          This is the REFERENCE implementation in the plan's sense: the Kokkos
 *          plugin compiles the same FvKernels.hpp bodies, and the §6.8 parity
 *          harness diffs the two element-wise.

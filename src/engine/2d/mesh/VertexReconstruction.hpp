 * instead of the flat-cell closure η = z̄ + h̄ which overstates η on cells
 * spanning a bed step. Fully wet cells reduce exactly to η = z̄ + h̄
 * (tri_cz is the vertex-elevation mean), so the closure is continuous and
 * consistent with the solver's conserved volume V = A·h̄.
 *

/**
 * @brief Wet-masked, depth-weighted free-surface reconstruction at vertices
 *        for RENDERING/OUTPUT only (writes state.vert_depth_signed).
 *
 * For each vertex, averages the free-surface elevations η_i of incident WET
 * cells (depth ≥ dry_depth) weighted by their depths, then stores the SIGNED
 * vertex depth η_v − z_v. Dry incident cells are excluded, so bed elevations
 * of dry cells can never lift the reconstructed water surface up an adverse
 * slope / bed step (the depth-weighted mean is bounded by the incident wet-cell
 * η's — no-new-maxima). A wet cell additionally votes only where its water
 * actually reaches the corner (wetted-contact gate, η_i > z_v), so a thin
 * film pooled at a cell's base cannot drag the level at the cell's high
 * vertex down to the film (no-new-minima follows from the gate — the mean is
 * bounded below by min η_i > z_v). Consequently the emitted field is either
 * strictly positive or the 0 no-data sentinel; readers should stay tolerant
 * of negatives from files written by older engines. A vertex with no
 * qualifying incident cell gets 0.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from reconstructVertexHeads(): vert_head is a SOLVER
 * field (gradients/limiters/fluxes and the active-set seed pass rely on
 * dry-cell head = bed elevation) and must keep its semantics.
 *
 * @param mesh      The mesh (with stencil topology built; uses stencil cell
 *                  lists only, not the pseudo-Laplacian weights).
 * @param state     Surface state (reads depth[], writes vert_depth_signed[]).
 * @param dry_depth Wet/dry threshold (m) — cells below it are excluded.
 * @param nthreads  OpenMP thread count for the per-vertex loop (1 = serial).

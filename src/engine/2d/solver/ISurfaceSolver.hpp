 * @brief Backend-neutral interface for the 2D surface-routing time integrator.

 * @details Extracts the solver contract that SurfaceRouter2D depends on so the
 *          concrete solver can be chosen at runtime:

 *            ISurfaceSolver
 *             ├── ExplicitInertialSolver      (serial CPU; default)
 *             └── ExplicitKokkosSurfaceSolver (GPU/threaded plugin)
 *
 *          This header is dependency-free (no Kokkos): it only
 *          forward-declares the 2D data types it passes by reference, so it
 *          compiles regardless of which backend — if any — is available.

 * @brief Abstract time integrator for the 2D surface-routing ODE system.
 *
 * The method set mirrors the lifecycle SurfaceRouter2D drives: one-time
 * setup, repeated advance, optional reinitialize after external state edits
 * (hot start), and teardown. The status accessors expose the most recent
 * integrator step count and step size for runtime reporting.
 *
 * Implementations are non-copyable (they own backend resources) and owned
 * by SurfaceRouter2D through a unique_ptr<ISurfaceSolver>; the virtual
 * destructor makes that deletion correct.

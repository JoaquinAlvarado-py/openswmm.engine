 * @file ExplicitInertialSolver.hpp
 * @brief Explicit local-inertial FV time-marcher for the 2D surface.
 *
 * @details Phase 1 of the 2026-07-29 2D reimplementation plan. A CFL-driven
 *          explicit marcher over the unique-face layout (InertialEdges):
 *          cell volume V is the conserved state (SurfaceStateData::volume,
 *          in place), one prognostic unit-width discharge q per interior
 *          face, semi-implicit friction, positivity limiter (V ≥ 0 always —
 *          no negative-volume debt machinery), and a flux-active cell set
 *          with lazy source-only integration for rain-on-grid thin films.
 *
 *          advance(t0, t1) ALWAYS reaches t1 (the step size is known a
 *          priori from the CFL bound), so none of the router's failed/frozen/
 *          partial-window machinery ever engages on this path. No linear
 *          solver, no Jacobian, no preconditioner.
 *
 *          Tiered local timestepping (LTS_TIERS > 1) lands in Phase 2; this
 *          phase steps the whole active set at the global CFL dt.

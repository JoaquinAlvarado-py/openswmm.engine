 *
 * Evaluates the bidirectional capped-pipe orifice exchange Q (m³/s; > 0 drains
 * 2D → 1D, < 0 spills 1D → 2D) from the CURRENT 2D state (head/depth/vert_head,
 * reconstructed live inside the CVODE RHS) against the 1D node head, which is
 * frozen for the duration of a 2D advance() window. Unlike
 * the retired computeCouplingExchange (which pre-computed a HELD flux per window and capped it
 * by available volume / dt to stop a held drain overshooting), this is the
 * continuous form for use inside the RHS: the orifice + capped-pipe gate + the
 * wet/dry Hermite ramp on the LIVE source-side depth make Q self-limit smoothly
 * as the cell drains, so CVODE integrates the stiff coupling implicitly and
 * stably across a large macro-window — no discrete avail/dt cap needed.
 *
 * Booking/conservation is handled by the caller integrating ∫Q dt (a per-point
 * accumulator carried in the augmented state vector) over the window.
 *
 * @param provisional_vol_m3 Optional per-cell volume (m³) overriding the 2D
 *        state's own depth/head for the driving-head and wet/dry-ramp terms.
 *        nullptr on the live-RHS path (CVODE's state is already current). The
 *        per-routing-step decoupled path passes the window's remaining
 *        withdrawal budget so the exchange self-limits as the surface drains
 *        provisionally — without it the frozen window state makes the same
 *        full-rate drain repeat every sub-step and the window's total exchange
 *        scales with the number of routing steps in it.

/**
 * @file VirtualJunctionOps.hpp
 * @brief Internal C++ API for virtual-junction editing: rule validation,
 *        derived geometry, set/clear flag, conduit split and pair re-fusion.
 *
 * @details Virtual junctions are zero-storage, momentum-transmitting
 *          JUNCTION-typed nodes connecting exactly two conduits of identical
 *          cross-section (see plans/VIRTUAL_JUNCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
 *          This module is the single source of truth for the usage rules —
 *          PostParseResolver (batch load-time validation) and the C API
 *          (swmm_node_set_virtual / swmm_conduit_split /
 *          swmm_virtual_junction_fuse) both call into it, so GUI, CLI,
 *          Python and MCP share identical semantics. Refactored engine only.

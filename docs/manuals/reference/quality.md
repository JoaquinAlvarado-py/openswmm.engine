## Abstract

SWMM is a dynamic rainfall-runoff simulation model used for single event
or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from
primarily urban areas. This document describes the water quality modeling
capabilities of SWMM. It covers the simulation of pollutant buildup on
land surfaces, their washoff during storm events, transport through the
drainage system, and treatment by various control practices. The manual
also describes how to model Low Impact Development (LID) controls for
managing stormwater runoff quality.
